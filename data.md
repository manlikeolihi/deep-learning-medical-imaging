### Key Differences Between CT and MRI in Pancreatic Cancer Evaluation

Based on the 2016 AJR paper by Jiang et al., *"Presurgical Evaluation of Pancreatic Cancer: A Comprehensive Imaging Comparison of CT Versus MRI,"* CT and MRI each offer specific strengths for assessing pancreatic tumors:

| Feature                      | CT (Computed Tomography)                                        | MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Modality Type**           | Ionizing radiation (X-ray)                                     | Non-ionizing (magnetic fields + radio waves)                |
| **Soft Tissue Contrast**    | Moderate (less contrast between tumor and pancreas)            | High (better detection of small or isoattenuating tumors)   |
| **Vessel Clarity**          | Excellent arterial/venous visualization with CTA               | Moderate (lower resolution in some cases)                   |
| **Tumor Detection Accuracy**| High; slightly less than MRI for small tumors                  | Higher sensitivity for small or isoattenuating tumors        |
| **Evaluation of Resectability** | Slightly better performance in vascular invasion grading     | Similar performance overall; better for soft tissue margins |
| **Scan Speed**              | Fast (typically seconds)                                       | Slower (minutes), requires patient cooperation              |
| **Availability/Cost**       | Widely available and cheaper                                   | Less available and more expensive                           |
