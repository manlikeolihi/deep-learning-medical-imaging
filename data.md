### Key Differences Between CT and MRI in Pancreatic Cancer Evaluation

Based on the 2016 AJR paper by Jiang et al., *"Presurgical Evaluation of Pancreatic Cancer: A Comprehensive Imaging Comparison of CT Versus MRI,"* CT and MRI each offer specific strengths for assessing pancreatic tumors:

| Feature                      | CT (Computed Tomography)                                        | MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Modality Type**           | Ionizing radiation (X-ray)                                     | Non-ionizing (magnetic fields + radio waves)                |
| **Soft Tissue Contrast**    | Moderate (less contrast between tumor and pancreas)            | High (better detection of small or isoattenuating tumors)   |
| **Vessel Clarity**          | Excellent arterial/venous visualization with CTA               | Moderate (lower resolution in some cases)                   |
| **Tumor Detection Accuracy**| High; slightly less than MRI for small tumors                  | Higher sensitivity for small or isoattenuating tumors        |
| **Evaluation of Resectability** | Slightly better performance in vascular invasion grading     | Similar performance overall; better for soft tissue margins |
| **Scan Speed**              | Fast (typically seconds)                                       | Slower (minutes), requires patient cooperation              |
| **Availability/Cost**       | Widely available and cheaper                                   | Less available and more expensive                           |

CT Image (A/B): Show a hypodense mass in the pancreatic head region. The tumor appears less distinct, and the surrounding vascular structures are moderately visualized..

MRI Image (C): Depicts the same tumor with enhanced contrast, providing clearer delineation of the tumor boundaries and better visualization of the surrounding soft tissue structures.


This visual comparison underscores the differences in imaging modalities, highlighting MRI's superior soft tissue contrast, which can be crucial in the detailed assessment of pancreatic tumors.
