### Key Differences Between CT and MRI in Pancreatic Cancer Evaluation

Based on the 2016 AJR paper by Jiang et al., *"Presurgical Evaluation of Pancreatic Cancer: A Comprehensive Imaging Comparison of CT Versus MRI,"* CT and MRI each offer specific strengths for assessing pancreatic tumors:

| Feature                      | CT (Computed Tomography)                                        | MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Modality Type**           | Ionizing radiation (X-ray)                                     | Non-ionizing (magnetic fields + radio waves)                |
| **Soft Tissue Contrast**    | Moderate (less contrast between tumor and pancreas)            | High (better detection of small or isoattenuating tumors)   |
| **Vessel Clarity**          | Excellent arterial/venous visualization with CTA               | Moderate (lower resolution in some cases)                   |
| **Tumor Detection Accuracy**| High; slightly less than MRI for small tumors                  | Higher sensitivity for small or isoattenuating tumors        |
| **Evaluation of Resectability** | Slightly better performance in vascular invasion grading     | Similar performance overall; better for soft tissue margins |
| **Scan Speed**              | Fast (typically seconds)                                       | Slower (minutes), requires patient cooperation              |
| **Availability/Cost**       | Widely available and cheaper                                   | Less available and more expensive                           |

> **Conclusion:** CT and MRI perform similarly for pre-surgical evaluation of pancreatic cancer. CT is preferred initially due to speed and availability, while MRI offers superior tissue contrast and may detect smaller or more subtle tumors. Ideal strategy may combine both modalities depending on the institution and case specifics. *(Jiang et al., AJR 2016)*
