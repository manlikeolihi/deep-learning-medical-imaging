# Literature Review â€“ Pancreatic Cancer & Deep Learning

## 1. Self-Configuring nnU-Net
- Task: Segmentation
- Data: Pancreas CT
- Highlights: Adjusts architecture based on data. Achieved top results in Medical Segmentation Decathlon.

## 2. ResNet50 for Tumor Classification
- Task: Classification (tumor vs non-tumor)
- Data: CT images
- Highlights: Combines CNN (ResNet50) with LSTM for temporal prediction

## 3. Swin Transformer for CT Image Classification
- Task: Classification
- Highlights: Uses Vision Transformers for image features, performs better than CNN on small datasets.
