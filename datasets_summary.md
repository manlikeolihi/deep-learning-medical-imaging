#  CT vs MRI â€“ Key Differences

CT (Computed Tomography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) are both used in pancreatic imaging but differ in several ways:

- **Modality:**  
  - **CT** uses X-rays to capture cross-sectional images.  
  - **MRI** uses magnetic fields and radio waves, making it better for soft tissues.

- **Clarity:**  
  - **CT** is generally better for visualizing bones and dense structures.  
  - **MRI** offers more contrast in soft tissues, which helps identify tumors.

- **Use Cases:**  
  - **CT** is more common for abdominal organ scans due to speed and cost.  
  - **MRI** is preferred when high contrast in soft tissue is needed (e.g., detecting small lesions in the pancreas).
