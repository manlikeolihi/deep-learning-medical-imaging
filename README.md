Initial question from projects.

Deep learning for medical imaging 

"We are seeking talented and motivated students to join our cutting-edge AI research project, Deep Learning for Medical Imaging. This project, in collaboration with leading hospitals, focuses on developing advanced deep learning models for diagnosing disease symptoms from medical imaging and clinical data, contributing to the next generation of AI-driven healthcare solutions.
 
You will work on state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning. You will gain hands-on experience in processing medical images, integrating clinical data, handling large-scale data processing, and designing robust AI models for disease detection and prognosis. Additionally, you will work on developing intuitive UI outputs to effectively visualize medical imaging results and enhance clinical decision-making.
 
This project offers an excellent opportunity for students to work closely with experienced researchers and medical professionals, and use this work for their thesis. If you are passionate about deep learning, healthcare AI, and impactful research, apply now and be part of this transformative project!"![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12227ec9-e21e-4825-a13d-e2ae0e7cd3b6)
