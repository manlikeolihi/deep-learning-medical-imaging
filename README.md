# deep-learning-medical-imaging-


Welcome to the project repository for my research on applying deep learning techniques to medical imaging, with a focus on pancreatic cancer detection and segmentation.

This project explores different models and datasets used in recent years, aiming to create a solid foundation for accurate and efficient pancreas segmentation methods.
Pancreatic cancer detection using deep learning techniques on medical imaging datasets.


This repository contains a curated collection of datasets, models, and literature for exploring deep learning techniques in medical imaging, with a focus on pancreatic cancer detection and diagnosis.

# MEETING SUMMARIES 
Date	Summary

March 18, 2025	Initial contact with supervisors. Assigned preparatory tasks: research vision transformers for image classification and outlier detection, explore open-source medical imaging datasets and codes related to pancreatic cancer.


March 22, 2025	First meeting. Agreed to maintain weekly updates and bi-weekly in-person meetings. Discussed conducting a focused literature review on pancreatic cancer imaging and practical exploration of CT, PET, and MRI data with AI models. Planned to use an AI prompting template for efficient data extraction from papers.


March 25, 2025	Follow-up: instructed to organize GitHub repository with datasets and model collections. Required details include dataset links, types, sizes, supported ML tasks, and backbone architectures of models.


April 3, 2025	Received positive feedback on repository structure. Advised to enrich documentation: add file overviews, detailed meeting summaries, a comparison between CT and MRI data, and an initial segmentation experiment using the Segment Anything framework. Tasked to collect literature from CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and MICCAI within the last five years focusing on semantic segmentation, medical segmentation, and pancreatic cancer.
