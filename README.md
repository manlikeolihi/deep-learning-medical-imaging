# Deep Learning for Medical Imaging  
## ü©ª Pancreas Segmentation on CT using Segment Anything Model (SAM)

**Author:** Olihi Ikande Idikwu  
**Supervisor:** Zhangkai Wu  
**Macquarie University, 2025**

## üß† Abstract

This project investigates the zero-shot capability of Meta AI‚Äôs Segment Anything Model (SAM) for organ segmentation in medical imaging, with a focus on the pancreas. SAM, trained exclusively on natural images, is evaluated on CT scans from the MSD Task07 dataset without fine-tuning. The goal is to understand SAM‚Äôs domain transferability, its limitations in medical contexts, and identify directions for future refinement modules.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Summary

For full model descriptions, see [`models.md`](models.md).

- **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**:  
  A promptable ViT-based segmentation model comprising:
  - **Image Encoder** (ViT)
  - **Prompt Encoder** (point, box, mask)
  - **Lightweight Mask Decoder**

- **Approach**:  
  - Zero-shot segmentation on unseen medical domains
  - Prompts: single point and bounding box
  - No fine-tuning, no domain adaptation

## üî¨ SAM Evaluation Pipeline

Notebook: [`sam_eval_pipeline.ipynb`](sam_eval_pipeline.ipynb)

This pipeline:
- Loads slice 55 of `pancreas_005.nii.gz` from the MSD Task07 dataset
- Applies:
  - Single-point prompt (inside pancreas)
  - Bounding box prompt (surrounding organ)
- Generates visual segmentations using SAM
- Overlays predictions with ground truth

A simplified version of the pipeline diagram is included here:

## üìä Results
