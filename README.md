Initial question from projects.

Deep learning for medical imaging 

"We are seeking talented and motivated students to join our cutting-edge AI research project, Deep Learning for Medical Imaging. This project, in collaboration with leading hospitals, focuses on developing advanced deep learning models for diagnosing disease symptoms from medical imaging and clinical data, contributing to the next generation of AI-driven healthcare solutions.
 
You will work on state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning. You will gain hands-on experience in processing medical images, integrating clinical data, handling large-scale data processing, and designing robust AI models for disease detection and prognosis. Additionally, you will work on developing intuitive UI outputs to effectively visualize medical imaging results and enhance clinical decision-making.
 
This project offers an excellent opportunity for students to work closely with experienced researchers and medical professionals, and use this work for their thesis. If you are passionate about deep learning, healthcare AI, and impactful research, apply now and be part of this transformative project!"![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12227ec9-e21e-4825-a13d-e2ae0e7cd3b6)

FOCUS 

Literature Review Focus:
I am to conduct a literature search with a strong focus on pancreatic cancer diagnostics and the application of machine learning (AI) in this field. This will help shape the context and methodology for my project.

Practical Exploration of Code and Data:
I will explore the existing code and results related to CT, PET, and MRI imaging using deep learning techniques. The aim is to understand how these methods apply to cancer detection and to experiment with the data where possible.

Data Extraction and Processing:
Part of my task is to extract relevant data from the reviewed papers and experiment with it to help shape potential solutions. To assist with this, I’ll be using an AI prompting template designed to accurately extract and compare data across papers without the inefficiency of manual, line-by-line review.

Model Comparison and Diagrams:
I’ll also be compiling relevant diagrams and models related to pancreatic cancer and evaluating different machine learning approaches. This comparison will assist in identifying the most promising modeling techniques for my project.




UPDATE FROM MEETING 1

Data Collection:
Please attach the links for each dataset.
Categorize them by data type (e.g., CT, MRI, sequence), data size, supported machine learning tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation), and medical imaging tasks (you might need to do some literature review for relevant questions).

Model Collection:
Include details on models for classification, regression, and segmentation.
Specify the backbone architectures (e.g., ResNet, U-Net, or other variants), the venue (conference or journal), and the time.
